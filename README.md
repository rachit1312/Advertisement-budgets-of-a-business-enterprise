The dataset contains ad budgets for different media channels and the corresponding ad sales of a firm in US $.

I'll be performing the following tasks here:
1. Finding the media channels used by the firm
2. Finding the sales figures for each channel
3. Creating a model to predict the sales outcome
4. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets in order to train the model
5. Finally, checking the accuracy of the model using MSE.
I'll build Linear Regression model to predict sales.

The repo includes '.csv' datafile, this readme, license, and my model titled 'Ad budget for different media channels.ipynb'
